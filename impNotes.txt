dev dependences -->  jis me development me kaam aata hai jab deplaoy karte hai toh koi zaraurat nahi hoti
dependences --> hamesha kaam aata hai

folder public/temp --> this is used in order to temperoraly keep the uploaded file in local for uploading because you dont want to be directly uploading because failure can occur at nay time

.env problem with module\


files inside src 
index.js --> main file for running
constant.js --> for keeping all the constants variables 
app.js --> it includes all the app related thing 
folders in src

installing mongoose dotenv express

mongoose is used to connec to database and 
error can happen so use try catch every time

1st 
import mongoose 
iffy ;()()
use async
try catch

2nd
new file db write new functio
import in index the execute

import dotenv 
the config give path 
and then 

go to pakage.json then add 
-r dotenv/config --experimental-json-modules

connectdb is async so it return a promise now then the thing is that you have to add .then() and .catch()

create app in app.js then export it 
then after connectdb add it in .then part of code 

imp --> app.use() is used when adding middlewares or configuration file


cors and cookie-parser

app.use(express.json({limit:"16kb"}))   now when the backend accepts only json limit upto only 16 kb

***
(err,res,req,next)

next --> middleware flag ye bolega agr kam hogay toh next middle ware pe jao\
***


higher order function woh func jo kisi  function ko parameter ki tarah accept karsakte hai 
and ya phir ruturn karsaakte hai 

const asyncHandler = (fn) =>async () => {}

now we are making a  miidleware function which is a utility because it is a hectic to make try catch every time when we are making async function now to solve that we have made sure to make a
asyncfunction which will take on the function and then return error if error or return the function if no errror


now make mongoose model user and  Video
index for searching



npm i mongooseAggregatePaginate-v2

 if (this.isModified("password"))   +> check if the password is modified 


 Creating custom methods in mongoose 

 userSchema.methods.isPasswordCorrect(){}

 JWT -> bearer token jiske pass ye hai wo allowed hai
